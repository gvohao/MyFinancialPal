# MyFinancialPal

A project influenced by my previous role as a wealth planning professional with DBS Bank, I wish to automate my pitch through the creation of this app.

In the landing page, users are greeted by quotes by respectable figures in the financial world in attempt to spark inspiration or motivation of users to take financial decisions into their own hands.

Calculations are generated based upon users' inputs.
Inflation adjusted results are projected on Singaporean CPI numbers by Department of Statistics Singapore.

Based upon the concept of Time Value of Money (TVM), retirement expenses are calculated using annuity due formula with the assumption that users would like to recieve their first retirement pay out from the day of retirement.

Retirement Savings was also based on annuity due formula, assuming users would like to start taking action TODAY but ordinaty annuity calculations could be used in the future to make more practical sense since this is made to be a forward looking financial planning tool.

Note that existing retirement savings were also projected towards retirement age at past inflation rates in attempt to devise a more accurate financial plan for users moving forward.
